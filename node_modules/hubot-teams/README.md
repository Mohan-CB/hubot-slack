# hubot-teams

Allows Hubot to keep track of what teams exist and to store information related to teams.

## Active Owners

Lets Hubot keep track of who is on AO duty for each team. Also notifies AOs when a review needed label is added to a Github PR.

AOs will also be notified when a master or release branch is force pushed to.

See [`src/robot-scripts/active-owner.coffee`](src/robot-scripts/active-owner.coffee) for full TomDoc documentation.

## Team Leads

Lets Hubot keep track of who is the team lead for a team. Team Leads will be notified when an attention everyone label is added to a PR.

See [`src/robot-scripts/team-leads.coffee`](src/robot-scripts/team-leads.coffee) for full TomDoc.
